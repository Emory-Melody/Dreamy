Simulation
===================================

In this section, we provide a tutorial of the simulation methods in **EpiLearn**. In general, we focus on the simulation of static and dynamic properties including graph structure and node features.

Static Properties
------------------------------
1. random static graph 
2. static features 
3. gravity model



Dynamic Properties
------------------------------
1. mobility simulation
2. SIR
3. NetworkSIR
